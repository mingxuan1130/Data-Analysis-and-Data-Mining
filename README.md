The resources I am currently using are:

"Statistical Forecasting: Regression and Time Series Analysis" available at https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411home.htm. This resource utilizes Regressit as an analysis tool. Its content starts with some basic concepts like the ideas of forecasting and the mean model, then progresses to regression analysis, and finally, it provides careful and detailed instructions on ARIMA. Along with explanations, it also offers many practical exercises.

One supplement to this resource that I am using is available at https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/.

After studying these, my plan is to proceed to https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1a/1a.1.
